# 동적쿼리

#### 동적쿼리를 해결하는 두가지 방식
- `BooleanBuilder`
- Where 다중 파라미터 사용



### 둘 다 Null이 아닌경우
```java
@Test
public void dynamicQueryBooleanBuilder() throws Exception {
    String usernameParam = "member1";
    Integer ageParam = 10;

    List<Member> result = searchMember1(usernameParam, ageParam);
}

private List<Member> searchMember1(String usernameCond, Integer ageCond) {

    BooleanBuilder builder = new BooleanBuilder();
    if (usernameCond != null) {
        builder.and(member.username.eq(usernameCond));
    }

    if (ageCond != null) {
        builder.and(member.age.eq(ageCond));
    }

    return queryFactory
            .selectFrom(member)
            .where(builder)
            .fetch();

}

```
- native query
```sql
select
    member0_.member_id as member_i1_1_,
    member0_.age as age2_1_,
    member0_.team_id as team_id4_1_,
    member0_.username as username3_1_ 
from
    member member0_ 
where
    member0_.username=? 
    and member0_.age=?
```
두가지 검색조건이 where절에 붙는다.

### ageParam = null
위 코드에서 ageParam = null로 바꾸고 실행하면    
아래처럼 age 검색조건은 포함되지않는다.
```sql
select
    member0_.member_id as member_i1_1_,
    member0_.age as age2_1_,
    member0_.team_id as team_id4_1_,
    member0_.username as username3_1_ 
from
    member member0_ 
where
    member0_.username=?
```
